    "## Description of Final Product\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores the relationship between data centers and Virginia's energy capability. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, we examine trends in electricity generation capabilities, producer types, and the impact of data center growth on Virginia's energy infrastructure. The final infographic visualizes key insights about how data centers are shaping Virginia's energy landscape, highlighting natural gas and other energy capability growth to allow for the ever evolving energy landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Topic?\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to investigate the intersection of data centers and Virginia's energy capability because NOVA is the largest data center market in the world, constituting 13 percent of all reported data center operational capacity globally. This rapid growth has created a critical need to understand how the state's energy infrastructure is adapting to meet this demand. The topic is highly relevant as data centers consume substantially more energy than other commercial or industrial operations, and their expansion is forecast to drive lots of increases in energy demand across the state. This analysis provides valuable insights into how Virginia's energy generation capabilities are evolving to support this data center infrastructure boom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The project employs exploratory data analysis techniques to examine Virginia's electricity generation data, focusing on:\n",
    "- **Temporal Trends**: How energy capabilities have changed over time, particularly in response to growing data center demand\n",
    "- **Producer Type Analysis**: Understanding which energy sources (natural gas, renewable, nuclear, etc.) are being developed to meet increasing needs by differnent producers. \n",
    "- **Percentage Change Metrics**: Quantifying the rate of growth and transformation in Virginia's energy landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis reveals shifts in Virginia's energy generation mix, with particular emphasis on natural gas and other energy sources that provide the reliability and capacity needed to support data center operations. The findings highlight both the opportunities and challenges facing Virginia's power grid as we need to consider the impacts that the data center growth can have on the rest of the State. "
