# How Data Centers Shape Virginia's Energy Capability

## Overview

This project explores the relationship between data centers and Virginia's energy capability through comprehensive exploratory data analysis. Virginia, particularly Northern Virginia, is the largest data center market in the world, constituting 13 percent of all reported data center operational capacity globally. This analysis examines how the state's energy infrastructure is adapting to meet unprecedented demand from the data center industry.

## Key Analysis Areas

- **Temporal Trends**: How energy capabilities have changed over time in response to growing data center demand
- **Producer Type Analysis**: Understanding which energy sources (natural gas, renewable, nuclear, etc.) are being developed
- **Percentage Change Metrics**: Quantifying the rate of growth and transformation in Virginia's energy landscape

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `Data/` folder to begin with the initial data exploration
2. Review the EDA notebooks in the `EDA/` folder for detailed analyses
3. Check out the `Final_Product/` folder for the complete project summary and infographic

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals significant shifts in Virginia's energy generation mix, with particular emphasis on natural gas and other energy sources that provide the reliability and capacity needed to support data center operations. The findings highlight surprising stats facing Virginia's power grid as it adapts to support the world's largest data center market.
